# Handwritten Character Recognition (EMNIST)

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to recognize handwritten alphabets (Aâ€“Z) from the EMNIST dataset.

## Features
- Dataset: EMNIST (Letters)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: PyTorch

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py        # Train the model
python test.py         # Evaluate on test set
python predict.py      # Predict single image
